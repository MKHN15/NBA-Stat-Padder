# NBA-Stat-Padder
Has codes for NBA Stat Padder site with source code for predictions and models.

Look at how far I have come in coding, where 2020 was mostly just copy and paste someone else's code with some modifications, to now where I am writing my code from scratch and way more complex than back then.
